# Project_MoSD
The following project describes the steps to implement an example of the modleR workflow. Furthermore the provenance of the execution will be tracked with REPRODUCE-ME.

## Zenodo
Zenodo, a CERN service, is an open dependable home for the long-tail of science, enabling researchers to share and preserve any research outputs in any size, any format and from any science.

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/374119276.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/374119276)

## Installation
You have to install packages in R and you have to install Java and Rtools on your device before you start the project. Go to the [Install.R](https://github.com/FlorianZe92/Project_MoSD/blob/main/Install.R) file to see a guideline for the installation of the R packages.

## modleR
modleR is a workflow, designed to automatize some of the common steps when performing ecological niche models. Given the occurrence records and a set of environmental predictors, it prepares the data by cleaning for duplicates, removing occurrences with no environmental information and applying some geographic and environmental filters.

This repository contains informations about the installation and use of modleR.

## REPRODUCE-ME
This repository contains scripts to parse the provenance output generated by the rdt package for the REPRODUCE-ME ontology, with a greater detail level.

In the directory [prov_console_2021-06-12T12.47.57CEST](https://github.com/FlorianZe92/Project_MoSD/tree/main/prov_console_2021-06-12T12.47.57CEST)
are the data of the execution from REPRODUCE-ME for the following code: [modleR_with_REPRODUCE-ME](https://github.com/FlorianZe92/Project_MoSD/blob/main/modleR_with_REPRODUCE-ME) 

## The example data set
You can choose between four different species. To receive the associated machine learning results of the chosen species you have change the code:
-species_name = species[1]: Abarema langsdorffii
-species_name = species[2]: Eugenia florida
-species_name = species[3]: Leandra carassana
-species_name = species[4]: Ouratea semiserrata

In the end you should receive the following results for the chosen species.


Abarema langsdorffii       |  Eugenia florida            |  Leandra carassana          |  Ouratea semiserrata
