# Project_MoSD
modleR is a workflow based on package dismo (Hijmans et al. 2017), designed to automatize some of the common steps when performing ecological niche models. Given the occurrence records and a set of environmental predictors, it prepares the data by cleaning for duplicates, removing occurrences with no environmental information and applying some geographic and environmental filters.
